# 👋 Welcome to Traivone's GitHub

Hi, I'm **Traivone Smith** — a cybersecurity and cloud enthusiast focused on **Cloud Security** and **Industrial (OT/ICS) Cybersecurity**. I’m building a portfolio of practical, hands-on security projects that bridge the gap between modern cloud infrastructure and operational technology environments.

Currently pursuing a **B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Information Security** at Southern New Hampshire University. My mission is to secure critical systems — from cloud workloads to industrial networks — using a defensive, automation-first mindset.

## 🔭 What I'm Working On

- 🌐 **Cloud Security Projects**: Designing and hardening AWS infrastructures (IAM, GuardDuty, CloudTrail, secure S3, Lambda).
- 🏭 **Industrial/OT Security Simulations**: Simulating SCADA/ICS environments with vulnerable Modbus/CODESYS systems.
- 🛠️ **DevSecOps & Logging Pipelines**: Integrating security into CI/CD and building log-driven detection tools (SIEM-style dashboards).
- 🧪 **Portfolio Development**: Publishing structured, themed projects under my "Cloud + ICS Cyber Lab" series with full documentation.
