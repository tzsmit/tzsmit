# 👋 Welcome to Traivone's GitHub!

Hi, I'm **Traivone Smith**, a cybersecurity and cloud enthusiast on a focused journey to specialize in **Cloud Security** and **Industrial Cybersecurity**. With a strong foundation in networking, ethical hacking, and industrial systems, I aim to secure modern infrastructures across cloud and operational environments. I’m currently pursuing a **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** at Southern New Hampshire University and preparing for the **Security+ 701 certification**.

## 🔭 What I'm Working On
- **Cloud Security Projects**: Designing and hardening AWS-based infrastructures, focusing on IAM, threat detection, and secure configurations.
- **Industrial Systems & OT Security**: Simulating Modbus/CODESYS environments to study vulnerabilities in SCADA/ICS protocols.
- **DevSecOps Integration**: Automating security testing and logging for cloud-native applications using open-source tools.
- **Portfolio Development**: Building consistent, cloud-focused security projects and documenting everything in GitHub and Notion.
